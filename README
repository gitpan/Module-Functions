NAME
    Module::Functions - Get function list from package.

SYNOPSIS
        package My::Class;
        use parent qw/Exporter/;
        use Module::Functions;
        our @EXPORT = get_public_functions();

DESCRIPTION
    Module::Functions is a library to get a public functions list from
    package. It is useful to create a exportable function list.

METHODS
    my @functions = get_public_functions()
    my @functions = get_public_functions($package)
        Get a public function list from the package.

        If you don't pass the $package parameter, the function use caller(0)
        as a source package.

        This function does not get a function, that imported from other
        package.

        For example:

            package Foo;
            use File::Spec::Functions qw/catfile/;
            sub foo { }

        In this case, ceturn value of "get_public_functions('Foo')" does not
        contain 'catfile'. Return value is "('foo')".

SEE ALSO

    Class::Inspector finds the function list. But it does not check the
    function defined at here or imported from other package.
